# Random Forest Algorithm from Scratch
## Introduction
This is a project to develop random forest classifier from scratch without `scikit-learn`. However, for Decision Tree Classifier, we still need the scikit-learn due to some issues.
Model asides, I also develop the `GridSearchCV` from scratch, altough some features such as selecting best parameters automatically has not yet added.
## Objective
The objectives are:
- Develop Random Forest Classifier from scratch
- Tuning the hyperparameter of the classifier with precision metrics
- Testing the model against a dataset

The dataset that is used for this project is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers?resource=download)
